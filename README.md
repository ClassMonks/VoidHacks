# VoidHacks
Aim to develop an application equivalent to match features of Apple's continuity feature for Android and other major platforms.

## About Application

We started off by choosing the languages required to build this project. So, we picked JAVA for Android and developed a Web-Application based purely on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We have used **FIREBASE** platform for backend support. 

**Android**: In order to build an application which can read an incoming SMS and read the device's state that if the device is ringing, Ideal, or on a phone call, we have asked several system permissions. 
Such permissions include:
  1. INTERNET
  2. READ_SMS
  3. SEND_SMS
  4. RECEIVE_SMS
  5. READ_PHONE_STATE
First permission allows us to access to the internet. Second and third permission let our application read the incoming SMS and also send one. Fourth permission lets us know when SMS are arrived to the mobile device and finally the fifth permission allows us to read the phone state in order to manage activities.

**Web-Application**: In order to build an application which can help organize workspace and show your phone's messages and calls. We have created front-end of the application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and used a cloud service- FIREBASE to manage database. 
We started by developing a link between PC and phone to share and edit notes on the go. We worked on android message push notification onto the PC for easier user experience.
